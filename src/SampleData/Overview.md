After you have installed the extension, you can add the sample Data Widget to your dashboards and start to create and explore VSTS with the provided sample data.
 
## Sample Data Packages
The extension uses Sample data packages which you can create and remove to and from any project. 
Currently we have two packages out of the box: 

#### Getting started with Agile & VSTS
Explore how you can create and work with work items and customize the agile boards.

#### SAFe with VSTS
Learn how to use the Scaled Agile Framework with VSTS. Sample Data generates the sample data discussed in the [Implement Scaled Agile Framework® to support epics, release trains, and multiple backlogs](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/work/scale/scaled-agile-framework) article.

## Add your own Sample Data Packages

***Currently we have disabled access to the configuration pane due to changes in how widgets handles configuration. We will bring back the capability to have your own custom Sample Data packages as soon as possible***

You can create and add your own custom Sample Data packages through the configuration pane.

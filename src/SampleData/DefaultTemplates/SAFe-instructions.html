                <h1>Implement Scaled Agile Framework® to support epics, release trains, and multiple backlogs</h1><p><strong>Team Services | TFS 2015 </strong> | <strong><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn798712%28v=vs.120%29.aspx">Previous versions</a></strong></p><p>As enterprises are benefiting from individual agile teams, the question now is how do we scale these practices across teams and gain a portfolio view of the progress of agile teams throughout the enterprise? To address these needs, many businesses are using the Scaled Agile Framework® (SAFe™).  </p><p>If you’re interested in using SAFe, you can configure projects created with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/work/guidance/scrum-process">Scrum</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/work/guidance/agile-process">Agile</a>,  or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/work/guidance/cmmi-process">CMMI</a> processes to track SAFe criteria. Moreover, just as your Agile tools support Scrum and Agile practices, it can support SAFe and large numbers of teams to work together on epics that span releases. </p><p>In this article you'll learn how SAFe concepts map to your Agile tools, how to plan and track SAFe projects using your Agile tools, and how to configure your Agile tools to support SAFe.  </p><p>If you’re familiar with Scrum but not familiar with SAFe, <a href="http://scaledagileframework.com/foundations">these videos at Scaled Agile Framework Foundations </a> from Inbar Oren, the Lean Samurai, are a good way to orient yourself.  </p><h2 id="MapSAFeconceptstoAgiletoolconcepts">Map SAFe concepts to Agile tool concepts</h2><p>The SAFe big picture addresses how a portfolio vision is met by a hierarchy of teams, all concerned with specific objectives. This framework breaks down epics into features and stories, which teams work on in Sprints and deliver through Program Increments (PIs) and Release Trains. Also, the portfolio backlog can track how deliverables map to value streams and associated budgets.  </p><p0><Img widht="300"  alt="SAFe architectural overview © D.

The examples build from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/work/guidance/agile-process">Agile process</a>, However, the changes can be applied to any team project hosted on Visual Studio Team Services or an on-premises TFS.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Agile tool structure to support SAFe" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-objects-map-to-vso-objects.png"></p><h2 id="SAFeportfolios_programs_andteamsmaptoAgiletoolteamsandprojects">SAFe portfolios, programs, and teams map to Agile tool teams and projects</h2><p>Because your Agile tools support a hierarchical team structure, each team has its own view of their work which rolls up to the next level within the team hierarchy.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="SAFe roles to Agile tool teams" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-roles-to-vso-roles.png"></p><p>To support SAFe teams, you reconfigure the default team as the Portfolio team to manage your epics. You then create sub-teams for program-level work and team-level work. Work can be tracked across teams and throughout each of the levels.</p><h3 id="SAFeportfolios_programs_andteamsmaptoAgiletoolteamsandprojectsSAFebacklogsmaptoyourAgiletoolsbacklogs">SAFe backlogs map to your Agile tools backlogs</h3><p>Out of the box, the Agile process supports user story, feature, and epic backlog levels. The hierarchical backlog structure shows work done to support features and user stories in the progress of an epic.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Hierarchical backlog: epics, features, and stories" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-epics-to-stories-value-area.png"></p><h3 id="SAFeportfolios_programs_andteamsmaptoAgiletoolteamsandprojectsSAFereleases_iterations_andsprintsmaptoiterations">SAFe releases, iterations, and sprints map to iterations</h3><p>SAFe Release Trains, Releases, Iterations, Program Increments (PIs), and Sprints map easily to your iteration paths. By sharing iterations across the team hierarchy, you manage the releases in a cohesive manner. </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="SAFe release trains map to Agile tool iterations" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-release-trains-map.png"></p><p>Because epics can span several release trains, the Portfolio team isn’t associated with any specific iterations. Program teams track their Feature deliverables, which ship with a PI. And Feature teams work in Sprints to complete several stories. Each team chooses which iterations will support them to track their focused set of deliverables.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Teams track deliverables using iterations" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-teams-track-deliverables.png"></p><h3 id="SAFeportfolios_programs_andteamsmaptoAgiletoolteamsandprojectsSAFevaluestreamsandbudgetsmaptotagsandtheValueAreafield">SAFe value streams and budgets map to tags and the Value Area field</h3><p>You can use tags for a quick and easy way to map epics to their Value Streams, strategic themes, and associated budgets.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Tags can track value streams or associated budgets" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/save-epics-value-stream-tags.png"></p><p>With tags that you add to work items, you can:</p><ul><li>Filter any backlog or Kanban board</li><li>Create queries based on tags, and filter query results by tags</li><li>Create progress and trend charts or reports based on tags </li></ul><p>For a more robust mapping of work to architecture or business features, you can specify the Value Area for each epic, feature, or story.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Value Area tracks Business or Architectural work" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-epic-to-stories-map-to-value-area.png"></p><h2 id="PlanandtrackSAFeprojectsusingyourAgiletools">Plan and track SAFe projects using your Agile tools</h2><p>Once you’ve configured your Agile tools to support SAFe, trace relationships can be created from stories all the way up to epics.

A customizable home page view is available to each team.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Team dashboard" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-team-dashboard.png"></p><p>Since so much of a program team’s work revolves around PIs and Release Trains, a custom report showing the scheduled shipping dates and what is projected to be on any given train might be useful. In addition, you can take advantage of the rich reporting options and the built-in reports the following services have to offer:</p><ul><li>When connecting to Visual Studio Team Services: <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/get-started/report/connect-vso-pbi-vs">Connect Power BI to Visual Studio Team Services</a></li><li>On-premises TFS: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd380714.aspx">SQL Server Reports</a></li></ul><h3 id="PlanandtrackSAFeprojectsusingyourAgiletoolsFeatureteams_E2_80_99viewofprogress">Feature teams’ view of progress</h3><p>For individual feature teams, their backlog view shows the Stories that they’re working on.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Migrate feature team backlog of stories" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-migrate-feature-team-stories.png"></p><p>Because feature teams don’t own epics or features, epics and features don’t appear in their team-level backlog views. However, if the team wants to know which epics and features their stories support, they can turn on those views from their backlog.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Migrate team backlog of stories to epics" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-migrate-team-stories-to-epics.png"></p><p>They can also break down their work into tasks and use the task board to keep themselves on track during specific sprints.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Migrate team Sprint 3 task board" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-migrate-sprint3-task-board.png"></p><p>The chart view of queries becomes very useful in the Innovation and Planning (IP) sprint, when feature teams work together to stabilize the features scheduled for a Release.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Bug charts" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-feature-team-active-bug-charts.png"></p><p>For everything else, it is very much business as usual for individual feature teams. They can sprint in their usual cadences, use their Kanban board and task board to track progress and break down work into manageable chunks.  </p><p>However, now their progress on individual stories is visible to their program and portfolio management teams. The management view reflects what they do.  </p><h2 id="ConfigureyourAgiletoolstosupportSAFe">Configure your Agile tools to support SAFe</h2><p>In this section, we’ll go from having one project, named "Fabrikam,” and one team, which shares the name of the project, to the following structure of three levels and nine teams. The area path hierarchy and configuring each team’s area path supports each team’s backlog view and rollup of views within the hierarchy.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Hierarchical areas support 3 levels of 9 teams" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-config-teams.png"></p><p>Each team project has a default team. You can configure additional teams for program-level and feature team-level work. And, you can also redefine the default team as the portfolio team that manages epics.  </p><p>In this way, all teams can manage their own workload and priorities while clearly understanding how their work supports those epics managed in the portfolio team’s backlog. At the same time, the portfolio team can monitor progress of its backlog on their own Kanban board, prioritize the items on their backlog, and view progress across release trains.</p><p>
                    All this might sound complicated, but it actually takes very little configuration to set up the teams and get started.
                    In order to go from one project with one default team, area, and set of iterations, we’ll first configure an area path structure to support the hierarchy of teams we want. Then we’ll make sure that the iteration paths support the release structure we want and the program and feature teams to use. Finally, we’ll create, configure, and populate the membership of teams.

                    In this section, we’ll show how to configure a hierarchical team structure which maps to the hierarchical area paths we created previously.
                    This structure maps the following SAFe teams to your Agile tools' teams:
                </p><ul><li>Portfolio team -&gt; default top-level team, the Fabrikam team  </li><li>Program teams -&gt; secondary-level teams, Fiber Suite and Service Suite  </li><li>Feature teams -&gt; tertiary-level teams defined under Fiber Suite and Service Suite.  </li><li>If you need more-detailed guidance, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/work/scale/portfolio-management">Portfolio management</a>.  </li></ul><p>You’ll need to be a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/tfs/administer/add-users-team-project">project administrator</a> to perform these steps. </p><h4>Create and configure each Program team</h4><ol><li><p>From the Overview page for the team project, create a new team. Make sure that you clear the checkbox for Create an area path with the name of the team.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Create team" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-create-team.png"></p></li><li><p>Choose the team from the list, go to the Areas page, and select the check box next to the area path that you previously created for that team.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Areas page, Program team, set default areas" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-map-team-to-area.png"></p></li><li><p>Use the context menu to exclude sub-areas. By excluding sub-areas, the team’s backlog only includes those items whose Area Path matches the team’s default area path.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Areas page for Program team, Exclude sub-areas" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-exclude-sub-areas-for-fabrikam-fiber-suite.png"></p></li><li><p>Next, configure the iterations that will be active for the program team. In this example, we have configured three PIs, each with five two-week sprints. Four of the sprints are regular sprints and the last sprint is an Innovation and Planning (IP) sprint.<br><Img widht="300"  alt="Iterations page, Program team" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-map-team-iterations.png"></p><p> Because the Fiber Suite program team is concerned with Release Trains, we choose PI 1, 2, and 3, but we don’t choose the individual sprints.</p></li><li><p>Once you’ve selected which iterations are active for the team, add users to the new team. Ideally, you would add the scrum masters for each feature team, product owners, as well as the Release Train Engineers (RTEs) to the program teams, such as Fiber Suite.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Add team members" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-add-team-members.png"></p></li><li><p>If you’ve more than one team at the program level, repeat steps 1 through 4 for each program team. </p></li></ol><h4>Create and configure each Feature team</h4><p>Next, we’ll create some feature teams to get work done at the third level of the team hierarchy. Each feature team will contribute sprint work that rolls up into the PI. The number of teams you create will depend on the size of your organization.</p><ol><li><p>Create a new team from the administration page for the original team, and name the team. Just like before, make sure you clear the check box next to <strong>Create an area path with the name of the team</strong>.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Create another team" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-create-another-team.png"></p></li><li><p>Just as before, choose the team from the list, go to the Areas page, and select the check box next to the area path that you previously created for that team.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Set default area path for Migrate feature team" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-configure-migrate-team-area-path.png"></p></li><li><p>Configure iterations for the team, using the PIs and sprints you created earlier. Unlike the program teams, this time select the individual sprints as the working iterations for the feature team.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Migrate team iterations" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-configure-migrate-team-iterations.png"></p></li><li><p>Lastly, add the accounts for the developers, testers, and the scrum master for the team. Your Agile tools support assigning a scrum master to multiple teams. The scrum master can track work across multiple teams.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Migrate team members" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-add-migrate-team-members.png"></p></li><li><p>Repeat steps 1 through 4 for each feature team in your organization. Make sure that the default area path you configure for the team is sub-area path under its corresponding program-level area path. This ensures rollup from feature teams to program teams.</p></li></ol><h4>Configure the Portfolio team</h4><p>Now that your sub-team structure is configured, we reconfigure the default team to act as the Portfolio team. While this team will continue to have the name of the project, the changes you make to this top-level team will help ensure that it effectively tracks epics across PIs at the highest level.  </p><ol><li><p>On the Areas page for the team project, change the settings so that sub-areas are not included. Make sure you choose the team project and not the default team, Fabrikam.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Areas page for Portfolio team, Exclude sub areas" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-exclude-sub-areas-for-portfolio-team.png"></p></li><li><p>On the Iterations page, clear the check boxes next to all iterations except for the root level, which cannot be cleared. Because the Portfolio team is only concerned with epics that span PIs, it only uses the root iteration and not the PIs or sprints. Portfolio teams don’t work in sprints.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Iterations page, Portfolio team" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-PMO_Iterations-cleared.png"></p></li><li><p>Lastly, add and remove users from the Portfolio team appropriate to this level. From the Overview page, choose the default team.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Overview tab, choose default team" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-overview-teams.png"></p><p> If you’re following SAFe, you’ll probably want to add portfolio managers, enterprise-level architects, and Release Train Engineers (RTEs) at this level and remove everyone else.</p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Overview page, Portfolio team members" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-overview-portfolio-team-members.png"></p></li></ol><h3 id="ConfigureyourAgiletoolstosupportSAFeUpdatetheAreaPathforexistingworkitems">Update the Area Path for existing work items</h3><p>For any existing work items to show up on a team’s backlog, you must update the Area path of each work item to the team’s default area path.

Similarly, you can only map the third level of backlog item (whether that is user story, backlog item, or requirement) to features. </p><p>Repeat this process at each backlog level until you’ve created the hierarchy you want. </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="Epics-to-stories view" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-portfolio-progress-view-epics-to-stories-any-team.png"></p><p>What about features already in progress? They definitely won’t appear on the Portfolio team’s backlog. They are the responsibility of the program teams, so they appear on that team's backlog. (This is actually a function of the area path set for the work item; a work item will only appear on a team's backlog if you assign it to the area path you created for that team.) You can map them from there.  </p><p>You can also <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/work/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel">bulk edit work items and manage their hierarchy in Microsoft Excel</a>.  </p><p>Since an important aspect of SAFe is to map work to business or architecture goals, you’ll want to make sure to set the Value Area=Architectural for any feature mapped to an architecture epic. (Because the default choice is Business, you don’t have to change the field for any item that supports a business epic.) You can also add tags to track the investment.  </p><p>The same principles apply to user stories in progress. You can map them to features, change the requirement type to Architecture for work that you do to support architectural epics, and add tags for tracking themes.  </p><p><Img widht="300"  alt="User Story work item form" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/scale/_img/safe-user-story-new-form.png"></p><h2 id="Relatednotes">Related notes</h2><p>There's no customization required to implement SAFe when working in Visual Studio Team Services or an on-premises TFS 2015 deployment.
